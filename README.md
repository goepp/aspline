# aspline: Fitting Adaptive Splines
## What are Adaptive Splines?

This package implements [A-Spline](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01770) regression, an adaptive procedure for fitting splines with automatic selection of the knots.
One-dimentional B-Splines of any non-negative degree  can be fitted.
This method uses a penalization approach to compensate overfitting.
The penalty is proportional to the number of knots used to support the regression spline.
Consequently, the fitted splines will have knots only where necessary and the fitted model is sparser than comparable penalized spline regressions (for instance, P-splines).

## Installation
You can install the `aspline`package directly from GitHub, which is the recommended option. Alternatively, you can also install this package by hand. Details are given hereafter.

### Recommended installation
You have to download the package `bandsolve` (on which `aspline` depends) from Github since it is not available on the CRAN. 

1. Execute in `R`:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("monneret/bandsolve")
devtools::install_github("goepp/aspline")
```

2. If `R` asks you which package you would like to update, there should be no need to update them: answer "None". If this breaks the package or prevents it from running, please [contact me](https://github.com/goepp/aspline#contact).

### By-hand installation
1. Click "Clone or Download" > "Download ZIP" to download the file "aspline-master.zip"
2. Unzip the zip file and rename the output folder "aspline-master" to "aspline"
3. Open a terminal in the folder where "aspline" is, and execute:

```
R CMD build aspline  
```

This builds the package, which is now present in the same folder, under the name "aspline_0.1.0.tar.gz" (version number may be different).

4. Install the packages in `R`:
```
setwd("path/to/the/aspline/package")
install.packages("aspline_0.1.0.tar.gz", repos = NULL)
```
5. If you get an error message saying that the package `bandsolve` cannot be downloaded, you need to go through steps 1 to 4 for the package [bandsolve](https://github.com/monneret/bandsolve).

Your package should now be installed! 

## Illustration of `aspline`

Below is an illustration of the A-spline procedure using the  [helmet](https://github.com/goepp/aspline/blob/master/data/helmet.rda) data.
The thick line represents the fitted spline and the thin line represents the B-spline basis decomposition of the fitted curve.
```r
library(aspline)
library(tidyverse)
library(splines2)
data(helmet)
x <- helmet$x
y <- helmet$y
k <- 40
knots <- seq(min(x), max(x), length = k + 2)[-c(1, k + 2)]
pen <- 10 ^ seq(-4, 4, 0.25)
x_seq <- seq(min(x), max(x), length = 1000)
aridge <- aridge_solver(x, y, knots, pen)
a_fit <- lm(y ~ bSpline(x, knots = aridge$knots_sel[[which.min(aridge$ebic)]]))
X_seq <- bSpline(x_seq, knots = aridge$knots_sel[[which.min(aridge$ebic)]], intercept = TRUE)
a_basis <- (X_seq %*% diag(coef(a_fit))) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  mutate(x = x_seq) %>%
  reshape2::melt(id.vars = "x", variable.name = "spline_n", value.name = "y") %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  filter(y != 0)
a_predict <- data_frame(x = x_seq, pred = predict(a_fit, data.frame(x = x_seq)))
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = helmet, aes(x, y), shape = 1) +
  geom_line(data = a_predict, aes(x, pred), size = 0.5) +
  geom_line(data = a_basis, aes(x, y, group = spline_n), linetype = 1, size = 0.1) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  ylab("") +
  xlab("")
```

For the sake of comparision, we display here the estimated P-spline with the same data.
The thin line also represent the B-spline basis decomposition.
```r 
p_fit <- mgcv::gam(y ~ s(x, bs = "ps", k = length(knots) + 3 + 1, m = c(3, 2)))
X <- bSpline(x_seq, knots = knots, intercept = TRUE)
p_basis <- (X %*% diag(coef(p_fit))) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  mutate(x = x_seq) %>%
  reshape2::melt(id.vars = "x", variable.name = "spline_n", value.name = "y") %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  filter(y != 0)
p_predict <- data_frame(x = x_seq, pred = predict(p_fit, data.frame(x = x_seq)))
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = helmet, aes(x, y), shape = 1) +
  geom_line(data = p_predict, aes(x, pred), size = 0.5) +
  geom_line(data = p_basis, aes(x, y, group = spline_n), linetype = 1, size = 0.1) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  ylab("") + xlab("")
```

The stricking difference between the two methods is that A-spline fits a far sparser model than P-Spline.
